# TechStore
This is a quick mock-up of an e-commerce website that deals with technology products.

This program was my final project for a junior level course dealing with PHP development.

It operates as a storefront where users can explore and purchase products. This includes an administrative side of the program, where the administrator can commit changes to the database in real time, committing them through the end-user interface.
